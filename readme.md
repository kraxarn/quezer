The spiritual successor to [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt). Spotify has started getting
less and less developer-friendly, so I think it's time to switch to another streaming service. This
repository contains a very work-in-progress client for Deezer instead, as they seem to be way more
developer-friendly.

This does not mean that spotify-qt will stop being maintained or anything, even when/if this client is stable!
